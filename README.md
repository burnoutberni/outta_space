# Outta Space

...is a web frontend for
[ScreenInvader](http://github.com/screeninvader/screeninvader) based
on [Janosh](https://github.com/kallaballa/Janosh) new WebSocket-API.

Project goals are to stay close to ECMAScript 6  with as little runtime
dependencies as possible, keeping the codebase read- and
hackable, and to provide a responsive and themeable userinterface.

At the moment it's highly experimental. Some basic features are not there
yet, changes in architecture and the API are to be expected.

Contributions are very welcome, the project is licensed under [AGPLv3
